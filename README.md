## ABSTRACT

A cutting-edge intrusion detection and automation system that uses advanced technology such as Computer Vision, Honeypot technology, and Neural Networks to accurately detect and classify intrusions in the network as well as the lodging. With additional features such as IoT technology, locking mechanisms, parameter directory sensors, and an Augmented Reality (AR) based application, development of a seamless and consumer-friendly experience that takes security to the next level.

Objectives:
1. Development of an advanced intrusion detection networking system, automation, and notification system using the latest Computer Vision and Honeypot technology, as well as Conventional Neural Networks-based network and home security systems.
2.Creating a hardware and software solution that accurately classifies the level of intrusion in a premises or Local Area Network/Wide Area Network.
3. Developing a coordinated framework and parameter directory sensors that provide a seamless security system.
4. Design and implementing an IoT-based locking system that prevents unauthorized access to the property using Computer Vision and Neural Networks framework.
5. Development of an Augmented Reality-based application to work with GenioSwitch (our unique product) to enable non-smart devices to function as smart devices without replacing them.
6. Creating an advanced notification and alarming system that alerts users in real-time when an intrusion is detected or when the locking system is applied.
7. Conduction of comprehensive market research to ensure that the system meets the unique requirements of businesses and consumers.

# First Contributions

This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

_If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.](#tutorials-using-other-tools)_

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/first-contributions.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.




## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add <your-name> to Contributors list"
```

replacing `<your-name>` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Where to go from here?

Congrats! You just completed the standard _fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request_ workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor!
